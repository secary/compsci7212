# Final Reflection of Human and Ethical Factors in Computer Science

## How has your understanding of human and ethical factors in computer science evolved throughout this course?
I have learned so much about human and ethical factors through this course, for example I don't know about th principles of designing programms and ethical principles. This course's vivid cases made me improve my understanding of ethical problems in data science.

## Also, reflect on which topic or case study sparked the most interest for you and explain why it resonated with you.
* The most interesting topic of this course for me is the scenario group's case. 
* Because it's collaborative and I've had strong participation during the process. My team members and I thought of our Newshack case together and communicated with different ideas. We have not met before but we could know each other well for we have a same destination. And thanks to this case study I gained the best team member I've ever had.
