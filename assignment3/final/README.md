# Task Description
This task requires you to investigate an ethical breach case from Assignment 3 Part 2. 

`Note: this is an individual task!`

 

You are a ***‘whistle-blower’*** for an ethical issue you want to report to your company management.

You should use the ethical breach that you’ve found to **define the area and the scope of the breach**.

"Let's say you work for a company that manufactures products that are marketed as environmentally friendly. However, you notice that some of the materials used in the products are not actually environmentally friendly and the company is making false claims in their marketing.

To define the area and scope of the breach, you would identify the specific ethical principle that is being violated, in this case, truthfulness and honesty in advertising. You would also determine the extent of the breach, such as the number of products affected and the impact on consumers and the environment. This would allow you to clearly articulate the problem and the potential consequences of the breach."

You should present your report *from the perspective of your role in the company* ('persona') and write it in a way that will allow more senior management to understand the issue and, thus, take action.

You need to identify and discuss these and make recommendations for strategies the stakeholder/s could use to make an ethical decision.

Your report is written to: For example, if you are reporting an ethical breach related to accounting practices, you might address your report to the `Chief Financial Officer (CFO) `or the `Head of Accounting`. The *person's name* and *position* should be clearly stated in your report.

You can use articles from journals and newspapers, work from researchers, government websites to gather information on the contemporary ethical dilemmas. You should refer to a *minimum of 5 various credible sources*.

Your report, written in *plain English*, should be a *formal document* which outlines the current trends, examples (if relevant), any challenges or issues (if relevant), strategies for ethical decision making.

The *format* of your report should include:

* cover letter (letter of transmittal)
* report title page
* table of contents
* executive summary
* introduction
* discussion
* recommendations
* summary and conclusions
* reference list
* appendices (if any).
Include a word count at the end of your Recommendations section.` Do not include` your [letter of transmittal](https://www.indeed.com/career-advice/career-development/letter-of-transmittal) to an external site., cover page, executive summary, table of contents, references or appendices in your word count.

 

### Whistle-blower Pitch

In addition,  you will submit `a 2 minutes recorded pitch` including `2 slides presentation (ONLY) in your pitch` to management and outline the ethical issues associated with your recommendations. This video pitch will need to be submitted together with the word report (*kiss method ! - 'keep it short and simple'*). 


You can record on your mobile phone or your laptop and upload video to MyUni Assignments. Alternatively, you could upload to YouTube and send the link in the report - whichever you prefer. It must be a professional standard - good audio, lighting and you must present professionally, wear professional dress code, as though you are pitching for a job, an opportunity etc. **DO NOT EMBED INTO THE DOCUMENT.**
