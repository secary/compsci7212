[Human and Ethical Factors in Computer Science](https://www.adelaide.edu.au/course-outlines/110024/1/tri-3/)
## Outline  
In this course, students will be introduced to two important areas in contemporary computing: human factors and ethical theory and practice. In human factors, students will study all areas that assist us in performing work in an appropriate manner. In ethics, students will study those areas that discuss whether the tasks that we seek to achieve fit our definitions of what is right for individuals, companies, and our society. By combining these two areas of study, participants will be introduced to tools, thinking, and analyses to establish whether the computing tasks they are being asked to perform are fit for purpose in terms of both usage and ethics. At the end of this course, students will have a sound understanding of key issues in ethics and human factors, be able to compare approaches and propose solutions, and have participated in a number of authentic activities to give them confidence as future professional practitioners in this sphere.
